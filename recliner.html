<p>My customer has two pieces in need of repair. Both pieces are
marked "Charles Harland"  inside the seat, a manufacturer which is no longer
in business. 
The first piece is a sectional incliner which has had problems since day one
in 1988. It sits about 1/2 inch lower than the other sections, and when a person
sits in it, it tends to open up at the wrong time.

of purchase is April 1988!</li>

<p>The second piece is a leather recliner. There is no label giving the
model number as in the first piece. It opens and closes properly, but does not
have a return spring to assist the user in returning the seat to its upright
position.

Three views of the mechanism. There is no sign of a broken spring, so it's
hard to tell where it might attach.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: I never did find an exact
match for the mechanism on one of the chairs (the sectional), but
happily it turned out that I did not need it after all &#8212; it
was just a matter of a broken screw holding the mechanism to the frame.
