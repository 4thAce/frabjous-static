<div class="storybody">My Linux machine went into spasms a while
back, not staying up more than a couple of minutes (just long enough
to tar up the data files and transfer them over to another disk).
My suspicion is that the problem was something having to do either
with the power supply, the motherboard, or the CPU. So now I have
things transferred over to Windows running Apache, and I think
more or less working. I also think I have the dynamic DNS client
from <a href="http://eurocomp.info/3D/">3DWatch</a> set up now.
With all the hurlyburly, things are going to be unstable for a while
though. You have been warned.</div>
