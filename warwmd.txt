In the three decades since Watergate, this is the first potential

<div class="storybody">Here in our corner of the country, most of the people
I'm in contact with were distinctly underwhelmed by the evidence in favor
of going to war. Since I consider myself to be left of center,
I was actually surprised that I was the only one who seemed even
slightly swayed by Secretary Colin Powell's UN speech describing what
the administration regarded as evidence for WoMD production in Iraq &mdash;
not on a purely logical level but by way of intuition of the man's
sincerity. But then the military operations started, being pushed it seemed
more by matters having to do with climate than with statesmanship. Yet
there still was this one possible decent justification out there, one which
still has not materialized.</div>
<div class="storybody">If the public has been lied to intentionally, then I
would have to change my notion that this had been more a matter of blindness,
intellectual laziness, and pride to one that there was a larger role played
by covetousness.</div>
